## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).

#### Running Test suite

```
$ mkdir /etc/ipsec.d
$ sudo chown -R $USER:staff /etc/ipsec.d
$ bundle exec rake
```

#### Building locally

$ gem build kingsly_certbot.gemspec
$ gem push kingsly_certbot-<version>.gem
